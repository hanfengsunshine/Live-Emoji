              <font size="5">With the pervasive use of communication tools,
                communicating in virtual space becomes common in
                everday life. In addition, with the rapid dvelopment of advanced multimedia technology,
                e.g., virtual reality, augmented reality, and so on, how to design tools to support communication 
                in such devices is important. As an extension of face-to-face communication, we study how to develop tools to support
                emotional communication in virtual space. The dimensional emotion model suggests that
                emotion is not a discrete state, which makes representing emotion more complicated. Following the
                recent proposed emotion distribution representation, in this line of works, we develop support tools
                for representing complicated emotions in virtual space.</font>

                Emotional experience is important for better social communication, and plays an important role in
                human-human
                interaction, human-robot interaction, and human-computer
                interaction. Allowing an agent to express diverse emotional
                states could engages its users better, and has attracted many
                research efforts recently.
                For emotional representation, one crucial question is how
                to define emotion itself. In general, there are three different
                points of view, i.e., discrete categories, e.g., Ekmanâ€™s six basic
                emotions, the dimensional model, e.g., the circumplex
                model, and the appraisal-based model, e.g., the Geneva
                emotion model, which can be seen as an extension of
                dimensional models. Discrete categories are shown to be
                cross-cultural, and easy for humans to recognize, but suffer
                from describing secondary emotions. Therefore, to represent
                diverse emotional states, dimensional models are expected.
                Another problem is which communication channel should
                be used to convey emotions. Works on displaying emotions
                include different sensory channels, for instance, temperature, color, embodied emotional feedback,
                vibration,
                visualization and animation, and the fusion of
                multiple signals, and so on.

              <font size="5">Live animation of 2D characters has recently become a popular way
                for storytelling, and has potential application scenarios like tele-present agents or robots. As an
                extension of human-human communication, there is a need for aug-menting the emotional communication
                experience of live animation. In this paper, we explore the emotional expressiveness issue of 2D live
                animation. In particular, we proposea descriptive emotion command model to bind a triggeringaction, the
                semantic meaning, psychology measurements,and behaviors of an emotional expression. Based on themodel,
                we
                designed and implemented a proof-of-concept 2D live animation system, where a novel visual programming
                tool for editing the behaviors of 2D digital characters, andan emotion command recommendation algorithm
                are proposed. Through a user evaluation, we showcase the usabilityof our system and its potential for
                boosting creativity andenhancing the emotional communication experience.</font>
